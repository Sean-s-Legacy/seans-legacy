# ðŸŒˆ Welcome to Sean's Legacy Project ðŸŒˆ

## Project summary

Seanâ€™s Legacy is establishing and implementing a professional mentorship program that will match LGBTQIA+ youth with LGBTQIA+ adults to help them prepare for college and careers. It entails video chat calls between mentors and mentees where mentors will have the opportunity to help mentees develop professionally, explain cultural workplace norms, and provide career and parenting advice in an LGBTQIA+ affirming safe space.

The product, built in collaboration with [TechFleet](https://techfleet.org/), will be an online platform that allows mentees to schedule meetings with mentors that align with their interests and career objectives. This productâ€™s goal is to implement a sense of belonging and hope to LGBTQIA+ youth in the hopes to prevent suicide ideation.

**development environment**

1. Run `npm run dev` to run the development server.
2. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/[x].tsx` - where x is the page name as seen in the url. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

**production environment**

1. Run `npm run build` to build your project (compile, minify and bundle project files).
2. Run `npm run start` to start production server (using the build files)
3. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

### Deploying

1. Commit your changes
2. Push them to the remote repository
3. Create a pull request against the develop branch
4. Once PR is merged, a preview link will generate in the slack channel `#seans-legacy-project-github`

- preview link will not be available if there are build errors but you can follow the link to view the specific error message. _You will need Vercel login credentials for this_

5. Once develop brach is merged into master branch, https://seans-legacy.vercel.app/ will deploy the changes.
