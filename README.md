# ðŸŒˆ Welcome to Sean's Legacy Project ðŸŒˆ

## Project summary
Seanâ€™s Legacy is establishing and implementing a professional mentorship program that will match LGBTQIA+ youth with LGBTQIA+ adults to help them prepare for college and careers. It entails video chat calls between mentors and mentees where mentors will have the opportunity to help mentees develop professionally, explain cultural workplace norms, and provide career and parenting advice in an LGBTQIA+ affirming safe space. 

The product, built in collaboration with [TechFleet](https://techfleet.org/), will be an online platform that allows mentees to schedule meetings with mentors that align with their interests and career objectives. This productâ€™s goal is to implement a sense of belonging and hope to LGBTQIA+ youth in the hopes to prevent suicide ideation. 

## Getting Started
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
### Prerequisites
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) 14.6.0 or newer
* ... more to come

### Installation
1. Clone repository to your local computer.
2. Open project in VS Code.
3. In your terminal, `cd` to the project directory. 
* It'll look something like `cd [file-path]/seans-legacy` depending on what your current directory is and where you saved your project
4. Run `npm install` to install project depencencies. 

### Contributing
1. Run `npm run dev` to run the development server.
2. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
