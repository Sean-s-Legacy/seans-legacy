# ðŸŒˆ Welcome to Sean's Legacy Project ðŸŒˆ

## Project summary
Seanâ€™s Legacy is establishing and implementing a professional mentorship program that will match LGBTQIA+ youth with LGBTQIA+ adults to help them prepare for college and careers. It entails video chat calls between mentors and mentees where mentors will have the opportunity to help mentees develop professionally, explain cultural workplace norms, and provide career and parenting advice in an LGBTQIA+ affirming safe space. 

The product, built in collaboration with [TechFleet](https://techfleet.org/), will be an online platform that allows mentees to schedule meetings with mentors that align with their interests, career objectives, or parenting circumstances. This productâ€™s goal is to implement a sense of belonging and hope to LGBTQIA+ youth in the hopes to prevent suicide ideation.
